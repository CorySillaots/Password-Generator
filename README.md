## Installation:
In order to access the files needed to complete the challenge see: https://github.com/CorySillaots/module-3-challenge and clone either the following HTTPS link or SSH key:
HTTPS Link: https://github.com/CorySillaots/module-3-challenge.git
SSH Key: git@github.com:CorySillaots/module-3-challenge.git
In order to clone the project to a "projects" directory, open your terminal (mac) or gitbash (windows) window and type the following commands into your terminal/gitbash command line:
1 - mkdir projects
2 - cd ./projects (You can use the command "pwd" to ensure you are in the correct directory)
3 - git clone <HTTPS link> OR git clone <SSH Key>
4 - ls (this will list all of the files now inside of the current directory)

Open your coding software, select "open file" and locate the module-3-challenge file in your projects directory OR find the correct file in your directory and "Open With" your coding software.

## Usage
- The purpose of the password generator is to create a secure passwords using various characters and lengths.
- The generator must take the user through a series of prompts asking if:
    - The user would like to use lower case letters.
    - The user would like to use upper case letters.
    - The user would like to use numbers. 
    - The user would like to use special characters.
    - The user would like their passwords to be between 8 & 128 characters (A list of special characters can be referenced at https://owasp.org/www-community/password-special-characters). 
- The generated password will be based on the users input and will be displayed on the screen.
